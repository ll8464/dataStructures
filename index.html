        <h1>Learning Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

        <p class="intro">In software development, there are various data structures and
            algorithms that allow for manipulation of data. There are usually
            tradeoffs in efficiency, assessibility, and space among the structures.
            It is useful to know how and when to use a particular structure as they
            are useful tools throughout development.</p>

            Below is a list of common
        structures and algorithms likely to be discussed during an interview:
