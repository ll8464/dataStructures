        <h1>Binary Tree</h1>
        
        <p class="description">
          Tree is a non-linear data structure that contains heirarchy. The tree consists of nodes and pointers. The root of the tree is 
          the highest in the hierarchy and is the parent node for all other nodes. A node's predecessor is called it's parent node, while nodes 
          linked below it is it's child nodes. Other nodes that are on the same level are called siblings. Edge is the link between a parent node and a child node. A node with no children is called a leaf,
          and there can be several leaves in a tree. A subtree is a section of tree where you assume a different root node. This effective creates
          a new tree. 

          Binary Tree is a more specific Tree structure. It allows for a max of 2 child nodes per node. The data is ordered so that every left node 
          is less than the right node. This causes the root to be the middle value of all values. This sorting makes the tree more efficent since if the value you're searching for is higher than root.value, you don't have traverse the left side of the tree and can start on the right child.
