        <h1>Graph</h1>
        
        <p class="description">
          The Graph data structure is potentially the most representative of daily life. It is a non-linear structure
          that can be used to represent relationships among data points called vertices. The connections between these
          vertices are called edges. 
          
          There are many kinds of graphs out there. The three that we will be focusing on are undirected graphs, directed
          graphs, and weighted graphs.

          Undirected graphs' edges do not have a direction which means there is a two-way relationship being represented.

          Directed graphs' edges have a direction. One way to visualize this is unrequited love. One vertex "loves", 
          or points, to another. However, the second vertex does not point back. 

          In weighted graphs, the edge themselves has an associated weight or value. It can be any metric such as time, 
          distance, etc. A common weighted graph is a map. The distance from point A to B is measured in distance, and that 
          distance is the edge between to two locations. 

          Let's go over some terminology unique to graphs. A Path is the sequence of vertices from one vertex to another, there 
          can be multiple paths. A Cycle is a path where the start and end vertex is the same. A negative weight cycle 
          is when the sum of all edges in a cycle is negative. Degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting the vertex.
          The term In-Degree applies to directed graphs. In-degree is the number of edges being directed to that particular vertex. 
          Out-Degree is the number of edges being directed from a particular vertex. 

          Disjoint Sets, aka union-find, are graph data structures that are often used to address the connectivity between the 
          components of a network. The parent node is the direct parent of a vertex. The root node, aka head node, is a node 
          without a parent node. It can also be stated that a root node is its own parent. This is important when determining 
          how vertices are connected among each other. 

          In Disjoint sets, you are creating unions (or sets) among vertices. A root node must be declared among the set. 
          To determine if a vertex have connectivity with another vertex, they must have the same root node. If they don't,
          they must merged and with a new root node declared. This causes all child nodes from the previously separate Sets 
          to now be related. 

          To solve disjoint set problems, you need a structure such as an array, to keep track of both value and index. The 
          index correspond to the vertices while the values correspond to the parent vertex. There are two main functions in 
          disjoint problems, the find() and union() functions. The find function returns the root node of a set. The union
          function connects the elements together by choosing their root node to be the same or and allows us to declare the
          parent node of a vertex.
