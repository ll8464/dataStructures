        <h1>Learning Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

        <p class="intro">In software development, there are various data structures and
            algorithms that allow for manipulation of data. There are usually
            tradeoffs in efficiency, assessibility, and space among the structures.
            It is useful to know how and when to use a particular structure as they
            are useful tools throughout development.</p>
        
        
          <p id="disclaimer">Ideally, the information here should be able to be applied to any modern programming language.
            That said the code examples are written in Java. In a practical sense, using the predefined data structures of the 
            language you are coding will be more efficient and robust than the custom ones seen here. However, you won't always be 
            able to choose your preferred language during an interview or the workplace.  </p>
